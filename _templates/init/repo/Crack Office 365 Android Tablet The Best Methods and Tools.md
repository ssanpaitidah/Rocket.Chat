# How to Use Office 365 on Your Android Tablet
 
If you are looking for a way to work on your documents, spreadsheets, and presentations on your Android tablet, you might want to consider using Office 365. Office 365 is a subscription service that gives you access to the latest versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more. You can also store your files on OneDrive, the cloud storage service that comes with Office 365.

There are two ways to use Office 365 on your Android tablet. You can either install the new Office mobile app that combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single app, or you can install the individual Office apps separately. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on your preferences and needs.
 
## The Office Mobile App
 
The Office mobile app is a convenient way to view, edit, and share files without having to switch among multiple apps. It also has some exclusive features that make it easier to work on your mobile device, such as transforming pictures into editable Word and Excel files, creating and signing PDFs, using Sticky Notes, and transferring files between devices.
 
To use the Office mobile app, you need to download it from the Google Play Store and sign in with your Microsoft account or your Microsoft 365 work or school account. If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, you will have access to extra features such as advanced editing tools, custom fonts, cloud storage integration, and more. If you don't have a subscription, you can still use the app for free with some limitations.
